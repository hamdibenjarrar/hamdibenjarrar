## 💡 Code Snippets & Demos

Below are a few code snippets that showcase my approach to problem-solving and creativity:

```javascript
// Dynamic Fibonacci Sequence Generator in JavaScript
function fibonacci(n) {
  const fib = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
  }
  return fib;
}
console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
# Simple REST API using Flask in Python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])
